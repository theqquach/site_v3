Hi, this page is under construction. Feel free to take a look but it's not done yet.

I’ve taken a lot of classes over my time in school, here are some of my favourites, or ones that I found the most interesting! 

## Economics
### ECON 408 Computational Methods in Macroeconomics
This was definitely one of my favourite classes I’ve taken. It was really a culmination of so many other classes. This class integrated macroeconomic theory, statistics, linear algebra, and computer science in an elegant and insightful way. Some topics included: 
- Asset pricing
- Linear state space models
- Models of consumption and saving
- Rational expectations
- Lucas trees

The professor for this class was [Jesse Perla](https://www.jesseperla.com/), an amazing prof. If you can go to his office hours and have a chat with him, he deeply cares about his students’ learning and will help in any way he can. You can also check out his github [here](https://github.com/jlperla), where the materials for past versions of the course are available. If you are at all interested in economics and computer science, I highly recommend taking this course.

### ECON 425 Advanced Econometrics
Econometrics was a challenging course, but it is definitely an important topic if you intend to go into research or academia. The problems sets in this class were a bit difficult, and the grading was sometimes a bit ambiguous or unclear. Econometrics involves similar concepts to math or statistics courses, except there is a specific application in mind. This causes some overlap between this course and STAT 305. However, there are topics unique to ECON 425 that make it work taking including:
- Endogeneity and IV in Models
- Linear Panel Models
- Limited Dependent Variables
- Program Evaluations

### ECON 370 Cost-Benefit Analysis

### ECON 345 Money and Banking
I took this class with Geoffery Newman, he’s a fun prof in my opinion, and although he is not as infamous as Gateman, he does have his moments. He structures his class like what I imagined a university course to be. He gives out notes and lectures from them. This course was very exam heavy with only a few assignments throughout the term. Since professor Newman has been lecturing for so long, he teaches his own models and which includes his three-sector model and his risk-return portfolio theory. Aside from that some topics covered in the class include:
- The Canadian Banking system
- Financial system basics (bonds, business cycle)
- Portfolio Theory
- Tobin model

## Statistics
 
### STAT 306 

### STAT 305 

### STAT 301 

### STAT 300 

### STAT 201

## Computer Science

### CPSC 330

### CPSC 210
This class was great because it included a personal project throughout the term. The project is very open-ended and the TAs are there to give you advice and help, so you really get out of it whatever you put in. The structure is very similar to that of a personal project so this is a good way to get into doing personal projects if you don’t know how they work. Personally, I found it to be somewhat hard because of my limited experience with programming at the time, however it was a good learning experience.
